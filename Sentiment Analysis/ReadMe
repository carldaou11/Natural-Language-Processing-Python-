Sentiment Analysis on Reviews
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of sentiment analysis on reviews data using five different models. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of these models and identify the most effective approach for sentiment classification.

Models
Model 1: Logistic Regression Model 2: Naive Bayes (NB) Model 3: Support Vector Machines (SVM) Model 4: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model 5: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Dataset
The models were trained and evaluated using a diverse and comprehensive reviews dataset. The dataset contains almost three thousands reviews from various sources, covering different domains. The reviews were labeled as positive or negative sentiment.

Usage
Google Colab File

Results
The performance of each model was measured using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of each model are presented in a comprehensive report, allowing for easy comparison and analysis.

Conclusion
Based on the evaluation results, the most effective model for sentiment analysis on the given reviews dataset is Model 1: Logistic Regression. However, the performance of each model may vary depending on the characteristics of the specific dataset and the problem domain.
